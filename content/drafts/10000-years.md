Deep inside a Texas mountain, a clock is being built.
Unlike other clocks, this one is designed for longevity on
a scale that's incomprehensible to the designers of similar
apparatuses; if all goes well, it will keep time for 10,000
years.

The clock (called the "[Clock of the Long Now][clock]") is a project of the
[Long Now Foundation][longnow]

* Long Now clock in mountain
    * Organization measures year with 5 digits

> The Long Now Foundation was established in 01996* to
> develop the Clock and Library projects, as well as to
> become the seed of a very long-term cultural institution.
> The Long Now Foundation hopes to provide a counterpoint
> to today's accelerating culture and help make long-term
> thinking more common. We hope to foster responsibility in
> the framework of the next 10,000 years.

> Civilization is revving itself into a pathologically
> short attention span. The trend might be coming from the
> acceleration of technology, the short-horizon perspective
> of market-driven economics, the next-election perspective
> of democracies, or the distractions of personal
> multi-tasking. All are on the increase. Some sort of
> balancing corrective to the short-sightedness is
> needed-some mechanism or myth which encourages the long
> view and the taking of long-term responsibility, where
> 'long-term' is measured at least in centuries.

## The walkaway test (#walkaway-test)

## Tweeting for 10,000 years (#tweeting)

* Set up program to tweet for 10,000 years
    * Prefix tweets:
        * LBI001 (LHI = long heartbeat interval)
    * Sent first tweet before publication

I'm going to try and hedge off a little bit of criticism
early by saying that this is just meant as a thought
experiment, and it's likelihood of making it to 100 years,
let alone 10,000, aren't good. See [Existential
threats](#threats) below for more.

### Hedging against failure (#hedging)

* Used Go -- shown good API stability
* Used Amazon -- big company that doesn't like to retire
  services
* No persistence -- relies entirely on Twitter's API
* Runs as a self-contained binary -- changes in bootstrap
  and dependencies are unlikely to change how it runs

## Existential threats (#threats)

* My program will not tweet for 10,000 years
* So the question is, what fails first?
    * Application bug
    * Binary incompatibility
    * Amazon:
        * Lambda API compatibility
        * Product retired
        * Billing
    * Twitter:
        * API key or OAuth application
        * API changes
        * Moves to a new pricing model
        * Folds as a company
        * No one home: Twitter becomes the living dead like
          ICQ
