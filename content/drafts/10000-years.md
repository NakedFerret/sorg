* Long Now clock in mountain
    * Organization measures year with 5 digits
* Set up program to tweet for 10,000 years
    * Prefix tweets:
        * HB001 (HB = heartbeat)
    * Sent first tweet before publication
* Used Go -- shown good API stability
* Used Amazon -- big company that doesn't like to retire
  services
* My program will not tweet for 10,000 years
* So the question is, what fails first?
    * Application bug
    * Amazon:
        * Lambda API compatibility
        * Product retired
        * Billing
    * Twitter:
        * API key or OAuth application
        * API changes
        * Moves to a new pricing model
        * Folds as a company
        * No one home: Twitter becomes the living dead like
