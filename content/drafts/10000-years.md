  Autonomous Software"

Deep inside a Texas mountain, a clock is being built.
Unlike other clocks, this one is designed for longevity on
a scale that's incomprehensible to the designers of similar
apparatuses. The counterweight for its drive mechanism is
housed in a hollowed out shaft that's 500 feet high and 12
feet in diameter and weighs an unbelievable 10,000 pounds.
The periodic chimes it plays are controlled by 20 huge
horizontal gears, each of which is 8 feet in diameter. Its
timing is controlled by a 6-foot pendulum assembly
terminating with football-sized titanium weights. It swings
as unhurriedly as one might imagine, taking a full ten
seconds to move back and forth. Components have been
machined to within tolerances of a fraction of an inch,
rather than thousandths, so that they'll keep working
despite inevitable entropic damage caused by the likes of
expansion and rust.

TODO: Picture of mechanism.

If all goes well, the clock will keep time for 10,000
years. It's called "[Clock of the Long Now][clock]", and is
a project of the [Long Now Foundation][longnow], who aim to
provide a counterpoint to today's accelerating trend
towards an ever shortening attention span in society by
fostering long-term planning and responsibility. They
consider long thinking to be on the centuries scale and
beyond, and their aim is to to construct frameworks that
will be functional for 10,000 years. As a reminder of this
charter, the Long Now represents years in five digits
instead of four -- to them, it's the year 02018.

Software might be one of the most reliably short-sighted
industries, and we could stand to learn a lot from these
sorts of experiments. Like about how to build programs that
will run without human intervention for longer, and how to
think more rigorously about the likely causes of defects.
To that end, I built a small Twitter-based program to
demonstrate the idea.

## The walkaway test (#walkaway-test)

## Tweeting for 10,000 years (#tweeting)

* Set up program to tweet for 10,000 years
    * Prefix tweets:
        * LHI001 (LHI = long heartbeat interval)
    * Sent first tweet before publication

I'm going to try and hedge off a little bit of criticism
early by saying that this is just meant as a thought
experiment, and it's likelihood of making it to 100 years,
let alone 10,000, aren't good. See [Existential
threats](#threats) below for more.

## Time and scale (#time)

It's a fun idea, but as you may have already surmised, my
program won't be tweeting for 10,000 years. Humans tend to
have a hard time imagining increasing orders of magnitude
(see [scope insensitivity][insensitivity]); we can all
easily to the arithmetic that there are 1,000 ten year
segments in 10,000, but it's difficult to appreciate how
much more time that really is.

Consider that the oldest pyramid, the Pyramid of Djoser at
Saqqara, isn't quite 5,000 years old, which is _ancient_.
As Cleopatra, and who lived alongside some of history's
other most famous characters like Julius Caesar, Mark
Antony, and Augustus, looked up the huge stone monuments
that were her country's legacy, consider that they'd been
constructed further back in history for her (she was born
69 BC) than she is for us. We have a few human artifacts
from as far back as 10,000 years ago, but they mostly
amount to fragments of pots.

## Hedging against failure (#hedging)

* Used Go -- shown good API stability
* Used Amazon -- big company that doesn't like to retire
  services
* No persistence -- relies entirely on Twitter's API
* Runs as a self-contained binary -- changes in bootstrap
  and dependencies are unlikely to change how it runs

## Existential threats (#threats)

* My program will not tweet for 10,000 years
* So the question is, what fails first?
    * Application bug
    * Binary incompatibility
    * Amazon:
        * Lambda API compatibility
        * Product retired
        * Billing
    * Twitter:
        * API key or OAuth application
        * API changes
        * Moves to a new pricing model
        * Folds as a company
        * No one home: Twitter becomes the living dead like
          ICQ
