One morning about three weeks ago I woke up and skipped my
morning coffee. Later as I was making my way to work, I
realized that I didn't feel any different than any other
day. I decided to continue the accidental experiment by
eschewing all forms of caffeine: coffee, tea, soft drinks,
and the various forms of [mat√©][mate] energy drinks that we
have at work.

Until then, I'd been drinking the equivalent of four or
five cups a day worth of coffee. Apparently I was drinking
_so much of it_ that its benefits like improved alertness
and reduction of fatigue just weren't working very well
anymore.

Unfortunately, its _negative_ effects were still in full
swing. I'd occasionally experience a midday crash. Worse
yet, I'm an anxious person as it is, and caffeine seemed to
further exacerbating that facet, even adding a physical
component to the problem in the form of jitters.

For me personally, quitting caffeine had no obvious
downsides, and some immediately noticeable improvements
(albeit minor) in quality of life. I still like hanging out
in cafes, and quickly found out which of my favorites did a
good job with decaf. I was even lucky enough to not even
experience any withdrawal symptoms.

With all of that said, I don't subscribe to absolutist
positions, and don't intend to take one with caffeine
either. I brewed some tea tonight and had my first caffeine
in almost a month. It was one most focused evenings I've
had in a long time: I got through about a hundred pages of
the book I'm reading, read a quarter of a two issues of the
Economist, and managed a late night meditation session, all
of which are normally activities that send me straight to
sleep if I tried any of them after eight o'clock.

When used in moderation, caffeine is a powerful tool. With
that said, I'm going to try and stay mostly away from now
on.
