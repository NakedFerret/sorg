One morning about three weeks ago I woke up and as
circumstances would have it, had to skip my morning coffee.
Later that day, as I was making my way to work, I realized
that I didn't feel any different than the day before, or
any other day. I decided to continue the accidental
experiment by eschewing all forms of caffeine: coffee, tea,
soft drinks, and the various forms of [mat√©][mate] energy
drinks that I've taken a liking to in recent years.

Until then, I'd been drinking the equivalent of four or
five cups worth of coffee a day. Apparently, I was drinking
_so much_ of it that its benefits like improved alertness
and reduction of fatigue just weren't working very well
anymore.

Unfortunately for me, its _negative_ effects were still
having their full effect. I'd occasionally experience
midday crashes or have trouble concentrating. Worse yet,
I'm an anxious person as it is, and caffeine seemed to
further exacerbate that facet, in the worst cases even
adding a physical component to the problem in the form of
jitters.

For me personally, quitting caffeine had no obvious
downsides, and some immediately noticeable improvements
in quality of life (albeit minor). I still like hanging out
in cafes, and quickly found out which of my favorites did a
good job with decaf. I was even lucky enough to not even
experience any withdrawal symptoms.

With all of that said, I don't subscribe to absolutist
positions, and don't intend to take one with caffeine
either. I brewed some tea last night and had my first
caffeine in almost a month. It was one most focused
evenings I've had in a long time: I got through about a
hundred pages of the book I'm reading, read a quarter of a
two issues of the Economist, and managed a late night
meditation session, all of which are normally activities
that send me straight to sleep if I try any of them after
eight o'clock.

Caffeine is a powerful tool, but apparently for me only
when used in moderation. I'm trying to keep this in mind
any time I think about having some these days.
