hook: On the modern age's ongoing assault on our concentration and thinking
  about problems in depth.

I good article came up on HN yesterday on the [subject of distraction and "deep
work"][deep-work]. A choice re-quote:

> One of the more embarrassing and self-indulgent challenges of our time is the

> unparalleled assault on our capacity to fix our minds steadily on anything.
> To sit still and think, without succumbing to an anxious reach for a machine,

I'm always excited to read this type of article because I feel validated in
that someone else has reached the same conclusions that I have independently.
Whenever I start thinking about a problem in depth, I can _feel_ my body and
mind trying to wander off course by checking my phone or opening a new tab in
Firefox. Worse yet, usually this destructive impulse wins, and I defer work on
the hard problems that I was meant to solve.

I'll often find myself stuck in "interruption cycles", where I look at one work
item, realize it's quite involved and so unconsciously give up on it by moving
to another one. Then I do the same with that one and the next until I've
arrived back to the original task. From there the circle repeats. It takes
directed effort to stop myself and push on just one of them in sequence until
they're done.

We hail tools like smartphones and Slack, but don't talk about how they're
effectively distraction machines; communication becomes so quick and easy that
everyone is interrupting each other all the time. The effect is particularly
corrosive in a corporate environment: as an organization grows the number of
possible combinations between any two nodes in that huge interpersonal graph
increase factorially, and ever more productivity is lost into the aether of
communication overhead.

So far my best answer has been to this problem has been to wake up earlier (5
AM or before if possible). My mental state at this time feels flexible and
sharp and is especially amenable to focusing on single tasks for extended
periods of time. There are also fewer other people around at those hours which
is an inherent help to curbing incoming interrupts. Throughout the day I'll
accumulate mental baggage and it goes back to normal; that's when I start the
daily grind of moving through my inboxes.

Unfortunately I expect our tools and the world to trend toward more distracting
and not less, so maybe the best thing we can do is recognize the problem and
try to exercise self-restraint when we can.
