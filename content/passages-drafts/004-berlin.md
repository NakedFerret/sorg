My return to Berlin started in the most Berlin way
imaginable. I touched down at 10 PM. I'd arranged to stay
the first couple nights with a friend because a local
holiday had pushed hotel prices up to $500 a night, and the
one burgeoning AirBnB rental market has seen a significant
cutback after the city made [a sizable part of it
illegal][lastairbnb].

He wasn't responding to any combination of texts or phone
calls. I didn't have his exact address, but knew roughly
where it was, and made my way by touch to his front door
and hit the buzzer. He made his way down the stairs bleary
eyed and I was afraid that I'd woken him up. I had, but not
because he's just gone to bed -- he'd been asleep all day
after a 36-hour stint and late return from the infamous
Berghain (billed as the best nightclub on Earth, and you
may just be convinced of that reading [this article from
the New Yorker][berghain]).

Ah, Berlin.
