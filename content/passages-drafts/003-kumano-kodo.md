Hello ... from the past. I'd intended to send this letter
out about four months ago, but am somehow only getting
around to it now. I picked out the photography that you're
about to see last December, but the pictures brought back
memories of such beautiful places that for the longest
time, I didn't feel up to writing the words to fill the
space between them.

Last year I wrote about a trip to Japan, but even after a
few thousand words of prose, I was only halfway done --
this is the missing second half. Last time I wrote about
how the country's metropolises are the best in the world.
That was true, but what I didn't talk about was how the
country also has the most beautiful wilderness on the
planet as well. Before going back to spend time in Tokyo,
Keiko and I spent a week down south in the Wakayama
Prefecture, making our way across the peninsula by way of a
series of ancient pilgrimage routes called the Kumano Kodo.

Fair warning that I'm about to talk about hiking, a lot.
I'm holding a rough pace of 3-4 messages a year, so I hope

Walking the Kumano Kodo is a singular experience. We might
think of Japan as a crowded island, but the lush greenery
surrounding you is pristine. The stones underfoot look a
thousand years ago, and the _torii_ arches overhead follow
a cultural tradition that's even older. I'm not a
particularly spiritual person, but I felt the ancient kami
of Japan. They were with me every step.

## Mount Koya (#mount-koya)

Our journey started in Osaka and our first destination was
Mount Koya, a holy mountain paired with a tiny town that
holds an incredible 120-odd temples. Normally, it's
possible to take a train and then use a mountain-scaling
[funicular] to get there, but the latter was out of
operation indefinitely due to damage from a recent typhoon,
so we took a bus up through the mountain's winding roads.

As the bus rounds one last hairpin bend, the magnificent
Daimon Gate appears out of the mist. It looks totally out
of place on these remote slopes.

![Mount Koya](/assets/passages/003-kumano-kodo/koya@2x.jpg)

Most of the accommodation on the mountain comes in the form
of _shukubō_, or "temple lodgings". Monks running the local
temples open their doors to visitors, who are fed and given
a place to stay and bathe in return for a nightly fee.

The temples are better run than any hotel. We walked
through the front door of the one we'd selected (Jokiin)
and were astonished to find a 4-by-6 grid of pairs of
slippers, arranged in perfect symmetry. We were led down
the hall, given a place to sit, and served tea while we
finalized a few details on the paperwork.

We were taken down long echoing hallways to our room, off
one wing of the temple and overlooking its immaculate
garden. One thing to understand about accommodation in
Japan is that it can often be quite small -- often just a
few tatami mats in size [1], and the constraints force a
certain creativity in the use of the space. Rooms are
silently transformed for you while you're out in the
evening, from a mostly empty space suitable for sitting, to
one with an unfurled bed suitable for sleeping. In a place
like Jokiin where your meals are served in-room, there may
be a third transformation to prepare the space for dinner.
We'd often find monks quietly swinging by our room hoping
that we were out so that they could re-arrange it. By
spending too much time in the room we'd compromise their
careful schedules because they wouldn't get a chance.

### The kotatsu (#kotatsu)

The monks' spartan lifestyle is that some of the luxuries
that we might take for granted in the west -- like central
heating -- are non-existent. This time of year the mercury
sits close to freezing, especially later in the day, and
even walking the temple's halls is a bone-chilling
experience. There's an on-site onsen, and its healing
waters will do wonders to warm you up, but afterwards
you're left with a real challenge: getting back to your
room.

In Japan there's an ingenious device for just this
situation called a [kotatsu]. It's a low table with
blankets hanging off its edges, and an electric heater
underneath -- a perfect place to spend a cold evening. The
old line in Japan is that once you're under a kotatsu you
can't get back out, and I found every word of it to be
true.

### A winter morning (#winter-morning)

We woke up the next morning to find a fresh layer of snow
on the mountain's temple roofs and courtyards -- the first
snowfall of the season. I ran from Daimon Gate up nearby
Mount Bentendake, trying to be mindful not to slip on the
newly slick paths and accidentally throw my camera (and
myself) into the underbrush.

## Yunomine Onsen (#yunomine)

Koya's technically reachable along the Kumano Kodo, but
along a leg that wasn't quite reachable with just the few
days we had. Instead, we bused back down to a coastal town
called Tanabe, and our real journey started the next
morning as we set out from its local trail head. After
another two days of hiking and an overnight in a charming
small town called Chikatsuyu-oji, we reached Yunomine
Onsen.

In [Passages 002][passages002] I talked about certain
villages famed for their onsens might adopt the word into
their name. This is the case for Yunomine -- a little
cluster of inns tucked into a valley in the hart of the
Kumano mountains. This was the one night on our hike that
we'd splurged on a hotel, and as we climbed its steps we
were greeted by Keiko's name drawn out in elaborate
hand-written Kanji. Every morning, the innkeepers wake up
and write out the names of the dozen or so guests who will
be staying the night.

The inn would draw out the complete set
of names of their guests every morning.

Our room was large and minimally furnished in the most
tasteful possible way, with only a single low table
ornamenting its expansive floors. A balcony gave us an
outlook onto the tiny village.

![Yunomine](/assets/passages/003-kumano-kodo/yunomine@2x.jpg)

A common pastime for locals and visitors alike is to slow
boil eggs in the hot spring's waters, and we found half a
dozen people working on just that when we arrived. You can
see some being sold for cooking below. Later in the trip
we'd visit Ōwakudani ("Great Boiling Valley") on the slopes
of Mount Hakone (an active volcano), where the onsen eggs
are black, having picked up coloration from the sulfur
springs they're cooked in.

### Tsuboyu (#tsuboyu)

The hot spring at Yunomine is _old_. It's considered to be
one of Japan's oldest, originally discovered about 1,800
years ago. An ancient bathhouse built right on top of the
stream running through town called Tsuboyu lets you get as
close as possible to the spring's source, and is the only
place in the world where you can bathe in a registered
UNESCO World Heritage Site.

![Tsuboyu (outside)](/assets/passages/003-kumano-kodo/tsuboyu-1@2x.jpg)

It's a popular bathhouse for couples, probably because its
pool is the coziest of quarters; even two is a tight fit.
Getting into the bathhouse is an adventure of its own,
involving a walk down to the other side of the village
where you can negotiate with an old man for a placard which
you will hang above the door as you enter. Its holds a
sequentially-assigned number that signals to waiting groups
roughly how long they have until it's their turn in the
building (we were waiting on group "7" above).

## Final day (#final-day)

The last day of our hike involved treeking over a
mountain blanketed in a broad-leaf evergreen forst. Unlike
a lot of mountain climbs you can do, this one featured
stone-cut stairs the whole way up and down, laboriously
dragged there over decades. It was cool and quiet. The
number of other hikers we passed along the trail could be
comfortably counted on one hand.

![Painted tree](/assets/passages/003-kumano-kodo/painted-tree@2x.jpg)

![Ancient forest](/assets/passages/003-kumano-kodo/ancient-forest@2x.jpg)

The mountain spit us out on the other side into Nachi
Taisha, an expansive Shinto shrine built halfway up its
face. Along with a breathtaking view out to the Pacific,
the shrine also overlooks Nachi-no-Otaki, Japan's tallest
waterfall at 133 meters.

The end of the hike was a bittersweet moment. While our
arching feet welcomed it, it was sad to see the trail go.
We were only partially comfortable by the consolation prize
of the beautiful vistas before us. We visited the foot
of the waterfall and checked in at a local inn with an
eccentric owner who asked for our schedule and nearly
refused to give us a reservation because he didn't think we
could make the last leg of our trip in time. The next
morning we made our way out to the ocean and onward to
Tokyo.

## Ponto-chō & beautiful alleys (#pontosho)

Like a hundred million visitors to Japan before us, we made
our way through Kyoto. We visited the traditional
attractions like [Fushimi Inari-taisha][fushimiinari]
(recognizable by its rows of hundreds of brightly painted
_torii_) and [Nijō Castle][nijocastle], but I was most
impressed by Kyoto's alleys. There's a famous one running
through the Ponto-chō district parallel to the Kamo river
that's particularly spectacular.

Lined with restaurants and businesses on both sides and
hundreds of people milling about to see them, it's
as vibrant of a public place as you'll ever find. Small and
human-scale, here it's people who are given priority
instead of the screaming traffic found on most city
streets.

## Wabi-sabi & aged leather (#wabisabi)

The last time a sole failed on one of my boots, I did
something unconventional. Instead of throwing it out, I
repaired it. While not quite the point of a existential
alarm, I've found it a little disturbing in recent years
just how disposable everything I own is. Half of it seems
designed with planned obsolescence in mind (I can measure
the year by counting how many Sennheiser earphones I sent
back for warranty), and half of it is just junk. Where
possible, I've been making an effort to buy higher quality
products that have some chance of longevity.

I wore these boots for the length of our hike in Japan. To
my pleasure, the trip only made them better. The leather
darkened, and they picked up a few more nicks and lines.
There's something distinctly beautiful about an object
that's aged well -- it's imperfect, and you can see history
and obvious ephemerality in its rugged appearanced. The
Japanese call this idea [_wabi-sabi_][wabisabi], an
aesthetic derived from the Buddhist teachings of the three
marks of existence.

## Rust and the pursuit of reliable software (#rust)

I've been working a lot recently with [Rust][rust]. It's
developed a bit of a reputation for its Haskell-esque (and
some might say Kakfa-esque as well) strictness when it
comes to compile-time checks, and at first I found working
with it to be intolerably difficult. But after a few months
those walls finally started to break down and I started to
like it, a lot.

Its oft-stated benefits like type safety, efficient use of
memory, and great performance are all true, but beyond
that there's just an element of consistency and good taste
that pervades throughout the language's design. It's a
pleasure to work with. Mistakes get fixed (exemplified by
the recent release of `impl Trait` and the upcoming rebuild
of futures and addition of native `async`/`await`. Its
community is helpful to a fault.

I wrote a piece about [building a web application in
Rust][rustweb] and another about [overcoming its sharp
edges][rustreflections].
