Hello ... from the past. I'd intended to send this letter
out about four months ago, but am somehow only getting
around to it now. I picked out the photography that you're
about to see last December, but the pictures brought back
memories of such beautiful places that for the longest
time, I didn't feel up to writing the words to fill the
space between them.

Last year I wrote about a trip to Japan, but even after a
few thousand words of prose, I was only halfway done --
this is the missing second half. Last time I wrote about
how the country's metropolises are the best in the world.
That was true, but what I didn't talk about was how the
country also has the most beautiful wilderness on the
planet as well. Before going back to spend time in Tokyo,
Keiko and I spent a week down south in the Wakayama
Prefecture, making our way across the peninsula by way of a
series of ancient pilgrimage routes called the Kumano Kodo.

Fair warning that I'm about to talk about hiking, a lot.
I'm holding a rough pace of 3-4 messages a year, so I hope
you'll consider this the polar opposite of spam, but as

Walking the Kumano Kodo is a singular experience. We might
think of Japan as a crowded island, but the lush greenery
surrounding you is pristine. The stones underfoot look a
thousand years ago, and the _torii_ arches overhead follow
a cultural tradition that's even older. I'm not a
particularly spiritual person, but I felt the ancient kami
of Japan. They were with me every step.

## Mount Koya (#mount-koya)

Our journey started in Osaka and our first destination was
Mount Koya, a holy mountain paired with a tiny town that
holds an incredible 120-odd temples. Normally, it's
possible to take a train and then use a mountain-scaling
[funicular] to get there, but the latter was out of
operation indefinitely due to damage from a recent typhoon,
so we took a bus up through the mountain's winding roads.

As the bus rounds one last hairpin bend, the magnificent
Daimon Gate appears out of the mist. It looks totally out
of place on these remote slopes.

Most of the accommodation on the mountain comes in the form
of _shukubō_, or "temple lodgings". Monks running the local
temples open their doors to visitors, who are fed and given
a place to stay and bathe in return for a nightly fee.

The temples are better run than any hotel. We walked
through the front door of the one we'd selected (Jokiin)
and were astonished to find a 4-by-6 grid of pairs of
slippers, arranged in perfect symmetry. We were led down
the hall, given a place to sit, and served tea while we
finalized a few details on the paperwork.

We were taken down long echoing hallways to our room, off
one wing of the temple and overlooking its immaculate
garden. One thing to understand about accommodation in
Japan is that it can often be quite small -- often just a
few tatami mats in size [1], and the constraints force a
certain creativity in the use of the space. Rooms are
silently transformed for you while you're out in the
evening, from a mostly empty space suitable for sitting, to
one with an unfurled bed suitable for sleeping. In a place
like Jokiin where your meals are served in-room, there may
be a third transformation to prepare the space for dinner.
We'd often find monks quietly swinging by our room hoping
that we were out so that they could re-arrange it. By
spending too much time in the room we'd compromise their
careful schedules because they wouldn't get a chance.

### The kotatsu (#kotatsu)

The monks' spartan lifestyle is that some of the luxuries
that we might take for granted in the west -- like central
heating -- are non-existent. This time of year the mercury
sits close to freezing, especially later in the day, and
even walking the temple's halls is a bone-chilling
experience. There's an on-site onsen, and its healing
waters will do wonders to warm you up, but afterwards
you're left with a real challenge: getting back to your
room.

In Japan there's an ingenious device for just this
situation called a [kotatsu]. It's a low table with
blankets hanging off its edges, and an electric heater
underneath -- a perfect place to spend a cold evening. The
old line in Japan is that once you're under a kotatsu you
can't get back out, and I found every word of it to be
true.

### A winter morning (#winter-morning)

We woke up the next morning to find a fresh layer of snow
on the mountain's temple roofs and courtyards -- the first
snowfall of the season. I ran from Daimon Gate up nearby
Mount Bentendake, trying to be mindful not to slip on the
newly slick paths and accidentally throw my camera (and
myself) into the underbrush.

## Yunomine Onsen (#yunomine)

Koya's technically reachable along the Kumano Kodo, but
along a leg that wasn't quite reachable with just the few
days we had. Instead, we bused back down to a coastal town
called Tanabe, and our real journey started the next
morning as we set out from its local trail head. After
another two days of hiking and an overnight in a charming
small town called Chikatsuyu-oji, we reached Yunomine
Onsen.


> Yunomine is a quaint little collection of inns tucked
> into a small valley deep in the heart of the sacred
> mountains of Kumano. The waters here are said to change
> color seven times over the course of a day. Yunomine
> Onsen was discovered about 1,800 years ago, and it is
> thought to be one of the oldest hot springs in Japan.

Greeted by Keiko's name on the side of the inn.

### Tsuboyu (#tsuboyu)

> Tsuboyu is a small cabin by the creek that runs through

> the only hot spring that you can bathe in that is

> popular with couples.

> The Kumano Kodō (熊野古道) is a series of ancient
> pilgrimage routes that crisscross the Kii Hantō, the
> largest Peninsula of Japan. These sacred trails were and
> are used for the pilgrimage to the sacred site "Kumano
> Sanzan" (熊野三山) or the Three Grand Shrines of Kumano:
> Kumano Hongū Taisha (熊野本宮大社), Kumano Nachi Taisha
> (熊野那智大社) and Kumano Hayatama Taisha (熊野速玉大社).

> Kumano Nachi Taisha is a Shinto shrine located halfway up
> Nachi Mountain, about 350 meters above sea level. It has
> its religious origin in the ancient nature worship of
> Nachi-no-Otaki. This grand shrine is part of the Kumano
> Sanzan and major pilgrimage destination.

> Nachi-no-Otaki is 133 meters high and 13 meters wide, it
> is the tallest waterfall in Japan and can been seen from

## Ponto-chō & beautiful alleys (#pontosho)

> Ponto-chō (先斗町) is a Hanamachi district in Kyoto,
> Japan, known for geiko and maiko and home to many geiko
> houses and traditional tea houses. Like Gion, Ponto-chō
> is famous for the preservation of forms of traditional
> architecture and entertainment.
>
> Ponto-chō centres around one long, narrow, cobbled alley
> running from Shijō-dōri to Sanjō-dōri, one block west of
> the Kamo River (Kamo-gawa). This is also the traditional
> location of the start of kabuki, and a statue of Okuni
> still stands on the opposite side of the river. The
> district crest is a stylized water plover or chidori.

## Wabi-sabi & aged leather (#wabisabi)

> In traditional Japanese aesthetics, Wabi-sabi (侘寂) is a
> world view centered on the acceptance of transience and
> imperfection.[2] The aesthetic is sometimes described as
> one of beauty that is "imperfect, impermanent, and
> incomplete".[3] It is a concept derived from the Buddhist
> teaching of the three marks of existence (三法印
> sanbōin), specifically impermanence (無常 mujō),
> suffering (苦 ku) and emptiness or absence of self-nature
> (空 kū).
>
> Characteristics of the wabi-sabi aesthetic include
> asymmetry, roughness, simplicity, economy, austerity,
> modesty, intimacy, and appreciation of the ingenuous
> integrity of natural objects and processes.

> A good example of this embodiment may be seen in certain
> styles of Japanese pottery. In the Japanese tea ceremony,
> the pottery items used are often rustic and
> simple-looking

[1] Tatami units.

> In Japan, the size of a room is often measured by the
> number of tatami mats (-畳 -jō), about 1.653 square
> meters (for a standard (Nagoya) size tatami). 
>
> * Kyoto – within this area, tatami generally measure

>   as Kyōma (京間) tatami.
> * Nagoya – In this region generally measure 0.91 m by
>   1.82 m, and are referred to as ainoma (合の間, lit.,
>   "in-between" size) tatami.
> * Tokyo – here tatami generally measure 0.88 m by 1.76 m.
>   Tatami of this size are referred to as Edoma (江戸間)
>   or Kantōma (関東間) tatami.

> Shops were traditionally designed to be ​5 1⁄2 mats,
