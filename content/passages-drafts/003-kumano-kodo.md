Hello ... from the past. I'd intended to send this letter
out about four months ago, but am somehow only getting
around to it now. The truth is that I picked out the
photography that you're about to see last December, but
ever since the pictures brought back memories of such
beautiful places and experiences that for the longest time,
I didn't feel up to writing the words to fill the space
between them.

Last year I wrote about a trip to Japan, but there was so
much to say that even after a few thousand words of prose,
I was only halfway done -- this is the missing second half.
Last time I wrote about how the country's metropolises are
the best in the world. That was true, but what I didn't
talk about was how the country also has the most beautiful
wilderness on the planet as well. Before going back to
spend time in Tokyo, Keiko and I spent a week down south in
the Wakayama Prefecture, making our way across the
peninsula by way of a series of ancient pilgrimage routes
called the Kumano Kodo.

Walking these trails is a singular experience. We might
think of Japan as a crowded island, but the lush greenery
surrounding you in these quiet places is pristine. The
stones underfoot must've been laid a thousand years ago,
and the _torii_ arches overhead imbued with a cultural
tradition older than that. I'm not a spiritual person, but
I felt the ancient kami of Japan. They were with me every
step.

Fair warning that I'm about to talk about hiking, a lot,
then software. If you're wondering how ended up in this
hell, as usual, you can [unsubscribe instantly by clicking

the polar opposite of spam -- if my track record holds,
you'll be getting about three of these letters a year.
(Thanks for reading.)

## Mount Koya (#mount-koya)

Our journey started in Osaka and our first destination was
Mount Koya, a tiny town at the top of a mountain that
somehow holds 120 temples. Normally, it's possible to take
a train and then use a cable car to get there, but the
latter was out of operation indefinitely due to damage from
a recent typhoon, so we took a bus up through the
mountain's winding roads.

Stay with Buddhist monks.  "Temple lodgings" (_shukubō_)

### An aside: The kotatsu (#kotatsu)

> A kotatsu (炬燵) is a low, wooden table frame covered by
> a futon, or heavy blanket, upon which a table top sits.
> Underneath is a heat source, formerly a charcoal brazier
> but now electric, often built into the table itself.[1]
> Kotatsu are used almost exclusively in Japan, although
> similar devices are used elsewhere: for example the
> Spanish brasero or Iranian korsi.

### Another aside: tatami units (#tatamis)

> In Japan, the size of a room is often measured by the
> number of tatami mats (-畳 -jō), about 1.653 square
> meters (for a standard (Nagoya) size tatami). 
>
> * Kyoto – within this area, tatami generally measure
>   0.955 m by 1.91 m. Tatami of this size are referred to
>   as Kyōma (京間) tatami.
> * Nagoya – In this region generally measure 0.91 m by
>   1.82 m, and are referred to as ainoma (合の間, lit.,
>   "in-between" size) tatami.
> * Tokyo – here tatami generally measure 0.88 m by 1.76 m.
>   Tatami of this size are referred to as Edoma (江戸間)
>   or Kantōma (関東間) tatami.
>
> Shops were traditionally designed to be ​5 1⁄2 mats,
> and tea rooms are frequently ​4 1⁄2 mats.

Small rooms. Unpack and pack bedding every morning and
night.

## Yunomine Onsen (#yunomine)

> Yunomine is a quaint little collection of inns tucked
> into a small valley deep in the heart of the sacred
> mountains of Kumano. The waters here are said to change
> color seven times over the course of a day. Yunomine
> Onsen was discovered about 1,800 years ago, and it is
> thought to be one of the oldest hot springs in Japan.

Greeted by Keiko's name on the side of the inn.

> The Kumano Kodō (熊野古道) is a series of ancient
> pilgrimage routes that crisscross the Kii Hantō, the
> largest Peninsula of Japan. These sacred trails were and
> are used for the pilgrimage to the sacred site "Kumano
> Sanzan" (熊野三山) or the Three Grand Shrines of Kumano:
> Kumano Hongū Taisha (熊野本宮大社), Kumano Nachi Taisha
> (熊野那智大社) and Kumano Hayatama Taisha (熊野速玉大社).

> Kumano Nachi Taisha is a Shinto shrine located halfway up
> Nachi Mountain, about 350 meters above sea level. It has
> its religious origin in the ancient nature worship of
> Nachi-no-Otaki. This grand shrine is part of the Kumano
> Sanzan and major pilgrimage destination.

> Nachi-no-Otaki is 133 meters high and 13 meters wide, it
> is the tallest waterfall in Japan and can been seen from
> far out on the Pacific Ocean. Nachi-no-Otaki’s water
> source is the surrounding broad-leaf evergreen primeval
> forest. It is a sanctuary of Kumano Nachi Taisha and thus
> has been protected since ancient times and is used for
> ascetic training by mountain monks who practice Shugendo,
> a mixed religion of foreign and indigenous beliefs.

## Ponto-chō & beautiful alleys (#pontosho)

> Ponto-chō (先斗町) is a Hanamachi district in Kyoto,
> Japan, known for geiko and maiko and home to many geiko
> houses and traditional tea houses. Like Gion, Ponto-chō
> is famous for the preservation of forms of traditional
> architecture and entertainment.
>
> Ponto-chō centres around one long, narrow, cobbled alley
> running from Shijō-dōri to Sanjō-dōri, one block west of
> the Kamo River (Kamo-gawa). This is also the traditional
> location of the start of kabuki, and a statue of Okuni
> still stands on the opposite side of the river. The
> district crest is a stylized water plover or chidori.

## Wabi-sabi & aged leather (#wabisabi)

> In traditional Japanese aesthetics, Wabi-sabi (侘寂) is a
> world view centered on the acceptance of transience and
> imperfection.[2] The aesthetic is sometimes described as
> one of beauty that is "imperfect, impermanent, and
> incomplete".[3] It is a concept derived from the Buddhist
> teaching of the three marks of existence (三法印
> sanbōin), specifically impermanence (無常 mujō),
> suffering (苦 ku) and emptiness or absence of self-nature
> (空 kū).
>
> Characteristics of the wabi-sabi aesthetic include
> asymmetry, roughness, simplicity, economy, austerity,
> modesty, intimacy, and appreciation of the ingenuous
> integrity of natural objects and processes.

> A good example of this embodiment may be seen in certain
> styles of Japanese pottery. In the Japanese tea ceremony,
> the pottery items used are often rustic and
> simple-looking
