          p I run a personal newsletter called <em>Passages & Glass</em> about exploration, ideas, and software. So far it's been about the world's least frequently sent newsletter, averaging about three to four times a year â€“ I like to think that it's about as far opposite on the continuum from spam as you can go. It contains no marketing, and really is just a collection of stories and thinking in a less formal medium.
          p You should consider signing up to get it. You can do so <a href="https://passages-signup.herokuapp.com/" rel="nofollow">right here</a>.
